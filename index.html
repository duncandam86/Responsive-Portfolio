            I was born in the USSR when my parents were pursuing their education. We moved back to Vietnam when I was less than 6 months
            old. I grew up in Vietnam until I was 8 years old and moved to Australia with my dad. At 14 years old, I received
            a scholarship to attend a boarding school in London so I packed my bag and moved across the globe. After spending
            5 years in London, a new adventure called my name, so again I moved across the globe to America to pursue further
            education. I moved to Chicago in 2009 to start my PhD at Northwestern and have been at the institution since
            then as a student, fellow and now an assistant research professor.

            My research at Northwestern focused on developing new therapeutic strategy for diseases. We employed a new found technology
            which used materials at nanoscale level to deliver active drugs to the disease sites. Our technology have worked
            in various diseases ranging from cancer to wound healing. My current endeavor is to apply this technology in
            immune diseases, especially ones trigger by viral infection. You can see more my research at
