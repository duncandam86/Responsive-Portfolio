            Unlike most people, I have an unusual and rather mobile childhood. I was born in the USSR in the 80s but grew up Vietnam.
            At 8 years old, I moved to Perth, a city in the westcoast of Australia, with my family. For 6 years, my life
            was full of constant relocation to different countries around the South Pacific due to my dad's job. In 2000,
            I received a scholarship to attend a boarding school in London, I packed my bag and moved to the UK. I spent
            5 years in London. And on a random night in my senior year, one of my closest friends suggested her desire to
            move to America. Instantly, I knew a new adventure was calling my name. A year later, I packed my bag one more
            time and moved across the Atlantic to America. I landed in Crawfordsville, IN - the smallest town that I have
            ever lived until this day - to attend college. I finally moved to Chicago in the Fall of 2009 to start my PhD
            at Northwestern. Since then I have been at the institution as a student, fellow and now a research staff.

            As a career scientist, my research at Northwestern focused on developing new therapeutic strategy for diseases. We employed
            a new found technology which used materials at nanoscale level to deliver active drugs to the disease sites.
            Our technology have worked in various diseases ranging from cancer to wound healing. My current endeavor is to
            apply this technology in immune diseases, especially ones trigger by viral infection. You can see more of my
            recent research at

            I enjoy traveling, working out and living a healthy lifestyle. I've spent a lot of my time volunteering especially with LGBT
            organization. I'm a member of the Chicago Gay Men's Chorus, the outNETWORK at Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago
            Pride Parade Organization, The National Queer Asian Pacific Islander Alliance. I also volunteer for the Center
            on Halsted and Howard Brown health. Please visit these websites for further information about these organizations
